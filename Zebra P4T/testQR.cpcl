A label file always begins with the "!" character followed by an "x" offset parameter  "x" and "y" axis
resolutions  a label length and finally a quantity of labels to print. The line containing these parameters is
referred to as the Command Start Line.
A label file always begins with the Command Start Line and ends with the "PRINT" command. The
commands that build specific labels are placed between these two co


<!> {offset} <200> <200> {height} {qty}


The x and y coordinates are expressed here in terms of dots. Coordinates in ( ) are for 200 dot per inch
printers. On 200 d.p.i. printers  8 dots (either horizontally or vertically) equal 1 millimeter and 203 dots
equate approximately to 1 inch.
Coordinates in [ ] are for 300 dot per inch
printers. On 300 d.p.i. printers 12 dots
Label Width
equal 1 millimeter  and 305 dots equate
approximately to 1 inch.

{command} {type} {x} {y} [M n] [U n]
{data}
<ENDQR>
where: {command}: Choose from the following:
BARCODE (or B): Prints bar code horizontally.
VBARCODE (or VB): Prints bar code vertically.
{type}:QR
{x}: Horizontal starting position.
{y}: Vertical starting position.
[M n]: QR code model number. Range is 1 or 2. QR Code Model 1 is the original specification  while QR Code Model 2 is an enhanced form of the symbology. Model 2 provides additional features and can be automatically differentiated from Model 1. Model 2 is the recommended model and is the default value.

[U n]: Unit-width/Unit-height of the module. Range is 1 to 32. Default is 6.

{data} includes some mode selection symbols in addition to actual input data character string. The type of the input data could be recognized automatically by printer software or set "manually". There is a separator (comma) between mode selection symbols and the actual data.

Data field format for Automatic data type selection:

<Error Correction Level><Mask No.><Data Input Mode (should be "A")> <Data Character String>
Error Correction Level should be one of the following symbols:
H - Ultra high reliability level (Level H);
Q - High reliability level (Level Q);
M - Standard level (Level M);
L - High density level (Level L).

Mask Number may be omitted or have a value from 0 to 8:
None - Automatic selection of the mask by software;
From 0 to 7 -- use mask with corresponding number (0 to 7);
8 - No mask.

Data field format for manual data type selection includes additional character mode symbols
and has the following format:
<Error Correction Level><Mask No.><Data Input Mode (should be "M")> 
<Character Mode 1><Data Character String 1>  <Character Mode 2><Data Character String2> < : ><:> <Character Mode n><Data Character String n>

Character mode symbols:
N -- Numeric;
A - Alphanumeric;
Bxxxx -- Binary Binary mode includes number of data characters (xxxx) represented
by 2 bytes of BCD code.
K -- Kanji

Different data fields (with their corresponding character mode symbols) are separated by
commas.

When the input mode is set to Automatic the binary codes of 0x80 to 0x9F and 0xe0 to 0xFF
cannot be set.
<ENDQR>: Terminates QR cod


FORM Command
The FORM command instructs the printer to feed to top of form after printing.
Format:
{command}
where:
{command}: FORM
In the following example  the printer will execute a form feed after the label is printed. See the SETFF
(set form feed) command in the section on designing receipts and lists for information on setting printer
behavior when the FORM command is executed


UNITS Commands
The units commands are used to specify a measurement system for all subsequent command fields in a
control session. Coordinates  widths  and heights for all control commands can be entered with precision
to four decimal places. By placing a units command immediately after the first line in a control session 
the specified measurement system will also apply to the offset and height fields. The printer measurement
system will default to dots until a units command is issued.
Format:
{command}
where:
{command}: Choose from the following:
		IN-INCHES
Measurement in inches.
		IN-CENTIMETERS
Measurement in centimeters.
		IN-MILLIMETERS
Measurement in millimeters.
		IN-DOTS
Measurement in dots.

TEXT Commands
The TEXT command is used to place text on a label. This command and its variants control the specific
font number and size used  the location of the text on the label  and the orientation of this text. Standard
resident fonts can be rotated in 90 ÌŠ increments as shown in the example.
Format:
{command} {font} {size} {x} {y} {data}

{font}: Name/number of the font.
{size}: Size identifier for the font.
{x}: Horizontal starting position.
{y}: Vertical starting position.
{data}: The text to be printed.

SCALE-TO-FIT Commands
The SCALE-TO-FIT commands automatically calculate the scale in order to fit text inside a window.
Format:
{command} {name} {width} {height} {x} {y} {data}
where:
{command}: Choose from the following:
		
SCALE-TO-FIT (or STF): Prints scaled text horizontally.

{name}: Font name.
{width}: Unit-width of the window.
{height}: Unit-height of the window.
{x}: Horizontal starting position.
{y}: Vertical starting position.
{data}: Text to be printed

SCALE-TO-FIT Command Example
Input:

SCALE-TO-FIT PLL_LAT.CSF 40 10 0 20 SALE PRICE
; Fit "SALE" text into a 40mm wide by 20mm high ; area
